# python-challenge

This project contains 4 different pieces, each providing a different analysis of a csv or plain text file.

### PyBank
In this challenge, I created a python script that analyzes financial data to provide the following:
* Total number of months included in the dataset
* Net total amount of profit/loss over the entire period
* Average change in profit/loss over the entire period
* Greatest increase in profits over the entire period - both month and amount
* Greatest decrease in profits over the entire period - both month and amount
Provides a summary table analysis within terminal as well as exported to a text file.
